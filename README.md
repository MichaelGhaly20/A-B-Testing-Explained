# A-B-Testing-Explained

### What is A/B Testing?
The purpose of **A/B testing** is to compare different content and design samples in pairs. However, this purpose may differ depending on the system in which we perform the test. In addition to being used mostly on applications, websites and advertisements, it is a test that can be applied in almost all decisions that can be taken thanks to the digital competencies we have. AB Testing outputs help us make accurate predictions. In summary, it can be said that they are experiments in which only one of more than one variable is changed and which variant performs better under equal conditions.
